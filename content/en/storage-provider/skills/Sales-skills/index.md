Being successful at running a Storage Provider business depends on multiple factors. Having the right technical skills and team is one of them, but not all. Another large aspect is on the business and commercial side.

## Business aspects
Running a Storage Provider business means investing in hardware and FIL collateral. The sum of both budgets means a significant amount of money, and growing your business will easily bring those budgets well beyond your initial investment budget.

Working with such budgets requires skilled business people, capable of running a business at scale. It also likely means interacting with investors, Venture Capitalists, banks etc. None of those actors will be keen to invest into your business if you don't have a skilled team on board.

## Commercial aspects
A Storage Provider needs to get storage deals to grow his network power and to earn money. There are at least 2 ways to get storage deals, each one requiring specific sales skills.

- Copies from Storage Providers and programs:

  Filecoin data programs specify the minimum amount of replicas for a deal. Programs like Slingshot and platforms like Estuary require a minimum of 6 replicas per deal. This means deals need to be stored across multiple Storage Providers in the ecosystem and you can work with peers in the network to share copies with and from them.

  Working in the ecosystem and building connections with other Storage Providers takes time and effort and can be considered a sales activity.

- Onboarding your own customers:

  The most impactful way to contribute to the growth of the Filecoin network is clearly by bringing your own customers to the network. Doing so requires business development skills and people on your team who actively work with data owners (customers) to convince them about the advantages of decentralized storage. 
  
  It takes additional effort to work with customers and their data, but it has the additional advantage of being able to charge your customer for the data being stored. This means an additional revenue stream compared to only storing copies of deals.

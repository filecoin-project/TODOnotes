When working with customers from certain industries, certain requirements might apply. Think of certifications and compliance standards like:

- HIPAA for medical data
- SOC2 for service providers
- PCI DSS if you are handling payments
- SOX for doing business in the financial sector
- GDPR for European data privacy regulation
- local regulations that vary per country (especially when doing business with the government)
- ISO 27001 security standard

Having one or more of these certifications will allow you to work directly with a different set of customers.
